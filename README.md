### TODO

- [X] Full player view
- [X] Possibility to browse by Artists, Genreâ€¦
- [ ] Optimize things
- [ ] Add some settings
- [ ] iPad version
- [ ] Persistence layer? probably not since it's quite fast on a local network and my 40K musical library evolve quite often
- [X] An app icon
- [ ] Better icons for consistency, I took random free icons on the net. Problem is my skills in design are (void*)0.
