### FEATURES

### TODO

- [X] Full player view
- [X] Possibility to browse by Artists, Genre, etcâ€¦ **[WIP]**
- [ ] Optimize things
- [ ] Add some settings
- [ ] iPad version
- [ ] Persistence layer? probably not since it's quite fast on a local network and my 40K musical library evolve quite often
- [ ] An app icon, that won't be me since my design skills are (void*)0
- [ ] Better buttons icons, I took random free icons on the net, but same problem as above
